As you know, C was originally developed by Dennis Ritchie between 1969 and 1973 at Bell Labs,
and used to re-implement the Unix operating system. It has since become one of the most
widely used programming languages of all time, with C compilers from various vendors
available for the majority of existing computer architectures and operating systems.
C has been standardized by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI)
since 1989 and subsequently by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).
